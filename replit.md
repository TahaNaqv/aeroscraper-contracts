# Aerospacer Protocol - Replit Development Environment

## Overview
The Aerospacer Protocol is a decentralized lending platform on Solana. It enables Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), aUSD stablecoin minting, and automated liquidation. The platform integrates with Pyth Network for price feeds and features a robust fee distribution mechanism. Its primary goal is to provide a secure, efficient, and scalable on-chain lending solution within the Solana ecosystem, establishing a new primitive for decentralized finance.

## Security Audit Status

**Comprehensive Security Audit Completed:** November 10, 2025  
**ALL Security Fixes Implemented:** November 10, 2025 ✅

A full security audit was conducted on all 16 instructions in the aerospacer-protocol contract. See `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for complete findings.

**Summary:**
- ✅ **16 Production-Ready Instructions (100%)**: ALL instructions now meet production security standards
- ✅ **All 6 Issues FIXED**: No remaining security gaps

**All Fixes Completed:**
1. ✅ **liquidate_trove**: Debt burning logic corrected - conditionally burns based on stability pool coverage
2. ✅ **liquidate_troves**: Token account validation implemented - prevents collateral redirection attacks
3. ✅ **initialize**: State persistence added (stable_coin_code_id), mint account properly typed
4. ✅ **update_protocol_addresses**: Address validation added - rejects default/duplicate addresses
5. ✅ **add_collateral**: Token owner validation added, neighbor hints properly enforced
6. ✅ **remove_collateral**: Token owner validation added, neighbor hints enforced, ICR minimum checked

**Production Readiness:** ALL 16 instructions are production-ready with comprehensive security validations in place.

## System Architecture

**Core Programs:**
The project uses Anchor v0.31.1 in Rust and consists of three main Solana smart contract programs:
1.  **aerospacer-protocol**: Manages core lending logic, CDPs, stablecoin minting, and liquidation.
2.  **aerospacer-oracle**: Handles price feed management, primarily integrating with the Pyth Network.
3.  **aerospacer-fees**: Manages fee collection and distribution.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The design prioritizes transparent and auditable on-chain interactions, ensuring all state changes and operations are publicly verifiable on the Solana blockchain.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
*   **Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs)**: Users can lock collateral to mint aUSD stablecoins.
*   **Stablecoin (aUSD) Minting**: Supports the minting of its native stablecoin, aUSD.
*   **Automated Liquidation System**: Ensures protocol solvency by liquidating undercollateralized positions, implementing Liquity's Product-Sum algorithm for reward distribution via a Stability Pool.
*   **Fee Distribution Mechanism**: A dual-mode system for distributing fees with comprehensive validation.
*   **Oracle Integration**: Uses Pyth Network for real-time price feeds with dynamic collateral discovery via Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).
*   **Cross-Program Communication (CPI)**: Utilizes CPI for secure and atomic interactions between sub-programs.
*   **SPL Token Integration**: Full support for Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens for collateral and stablecoin operations.
*   **Sorted Troves (Off-Chain Architecture)**: Employs off-chain sorting with on-chain ICR validation, passing only neighbor hints for validation to eliminate on-chain linked list storage. Includes critical PDA verification.
*   **Individual Collateral Ratio (ICR)**: Real-time ICR calculations support multi-collateral types and solvency checks.
*   **Redemption System**: Accepts pre-sorted trove lists, validates ICR ordering, and supports both full and partial redemptions.

**System Design Choices:**
*   **Anchor Framework**: Utilized for Solana smart contract development.
*   **Rust & TypeScript**: Rust for on-chain programs and TypeScript for off-chain tests and interactions.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns into distinct programs (`protocol`, `oracle`, `fees`).
*   **Security Features**: Includes safe math operations, access control, input validation, atomic state consistency, PDA validation, and optimization for Solana BPF stack limits.
*   **Two-Instruction Architecture for Liquidation**: Separates data traversal from execution to optimize account ordering.
*   **Vault Signing Architecture**: All PDA vault authorities correctly sign CPIs using `invoke_signed`.
*   **BPF Stack Optimization**: Uses `UncheckedAccount` pattern to mitigate Solana BPF stack limits.

## External Dependencies
